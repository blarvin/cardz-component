# Cardz-Component

A web application designed to demonstrate a UI card component that is both draggable and resizable. This project showcases the development of modular, reusable UI components in a web application setting, focusing on user interaction and dynamic content manipulation.

## Overview

The project architecture is built on Vanilla JavaScript for front-end logic and styling, with Node.js for a simple server setup. The application serves static files without the need for Express, simplifying the architecture to focus on the front-end components. Technologies used include HTML and CSS for structure and styling, and Vanilla JavaScript to enable the dynamic features of the card components.

## Features

- Users can dynamically create new UI card components.
- Cards can be dragged across the screen and resized using mouse interactions.
- The application starts with a single card, with the ability to add more and interact with each individually.
- Minimalistic design emphasizes functionality and user interaction over complex aesthetics.
